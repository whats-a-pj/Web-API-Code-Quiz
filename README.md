I used these websites to help me complete the project as well as things to experiment with, seeing what does and doesn't work:

I had a study group on 7/9 with Brian Whisler, Jeremy Rapich, Timothy Morgan and Salvador Mejia where we pretty much just talked about how hard this assignment was as opposed to really working on specific issues. We did brainstorm ways of implementing the problems we needed to solve based on the acceptance criteria though and that got some of the creative juices flowing.

I had help from J.K. and Oscarlos Gomez Rosario with AskBCS, they both helped guide me take the whole of the project and turn it into smaller easier tasks to solve in an order that would make creating the entire thing a smoother process, and sent me on a more clear path once I laid out most of the code I knew I would need to solve this challenge.

I had a tutoring session on 7/11 with Jacob Carver after struggling with this assignment for a week and exhausting my resources. I walked him through my code and he let me know I was actually on the right path which was very encouraging. He patiently walked me through why some of my functions weren't working correctly and made sure I understood what he meant along the way.
